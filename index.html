            <p>		As the lioness lifts her head, it is obvious that her eyesight is impaired, possibly by cataracts? Another theory was that this was the result of a spitting cobra encounter, but we weren't certain.

"Then," said Steyn, "all of a sudden, hyenas came down the road."
Initially, the hyenas appear unaware that there is a lion nearby. As for the lion, despite turning her head in their direction, she too seemed oblivious.

However, shortly after passing behind the lion, they picked up her scent. Although the hyenas outnumbered the lioness, they approached with caution. As apex predators, the two species are age-old enemies with a healthy respect for one another.

Driven by curiosity and the lion's apparent indifference to them, the hyenas approached ever closer.

Hearing their movement in the grass, the lioness turned her head towards their rustling. However, whether because she is blind or too weak, she doesn't react.

Approaching closer, the hyena's agitation is evident by the sight of their cocked tails. Strangely, they do not whoop, as such vocalisations often accompany excitement among hyenas.

If anything, the hyenas appear confused, presumably expecting a much more aggressive response from the lioness. However, aside from turning toward them, the lion only growls softly.

What makes this sighting so unusual is the apparent calm behaviour of the two species. Violent clashes are more the norm.

Ordinarily, lone individuals -- especially those injured -- are set upon with little hesitation. In this case, the hyena's behaviour suggests only curiosity. In human terms, there is even a hint of pity on display.

            <p>		Even so, the fact that they seldom come closer than a couple of metres to the lion suggests that there is still cautious respect.

Possibly, the hyenas conclude that the lioness is no longer a threat, nor worthy of the risks involved in killing her.

As if the lioness is too weak to hold her head up, she once again rests her chin on the ground. It is a pitiful sight to see this regal cat in such a poor state.

Still, the hyenas leave her in peace. The only indication of dominant behaviour seen is when one individual scent marks nearby.

The video concludes with the lioness still resting as the hyenas move on. Although we are left to guess her ultimate fate, the chances are high that she would not survive for much longer.			</p>
